# Getting Started

This guide walks you through the complete process of using our CAPTCHA Solver — from account creation to solving your first CAPTCHA using our API.

You’ll be up and running in just a few minutes.

---

## Step 1: Create an Account

Before using our CAPTCHA-solving services, you need to create an account.

Once registered, you’ll gain access to:

- Your personal dashboard
- API key management
- Usage and credit tracking
- Request analytics

Create your account from the **Sign Up** page.

---

## Step 2: Purchase Credits

Our platform uses a **credit-based pricing model**.

Before making API requests, you must purchase credits to activate CAPTCHA-solving APIs.

### Why Credits?

- No subscriptions
- No recurring fees
- Pay only for what you use

Credits are deducted automatically based on successful CAPTCHA solves.

---

## Step 3: Get Your API Key

After purchasing credits, you can generate your API key from the dashboard.

Your API key is required to authenticate every API request.

**Keep your API key secure**. Do not expose it in client-side code or public repositories.

---

## Step 4: Create a CAPTCHA Task

With your API key ready, you can now submit CAPTCHA-solving requests.

Below is an example of creating an **image CAPTCHA task**.

### Create Task Request

```http
const response = await fetch("/api/imageCaptcha", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    imageUrl: "https://example.com/captcha.png",
  }),
});
```

If your request is valid and your account has sufficient credits, you’ll receive a successful response.

---

## Supported CAPTCHA Task Types

Our CAPTCHA Solver supports multiple task types, depending on the CAPTCHA format:

- **Image CAPTCHA Recognition**
- **Text CAPTCHA Parsing**
- **Audio CAPTCHA Transcription**

Each task type is optimized for speed and accuracy.

---

## Step 5: Get Task Result

Most image and text CAPTCHA tasks return results instantly.  
Some tasks (such as complex audio CAPTCHAs) may require a short processing delay.

A successful response looks like this:

```json
{
  "text": "X7K9P"
}
```

Tasks complete within 1–10 seconds.

## Error Handling

If a request fails, the response will include an error message explaining the issue, such as:

- Invalid API key
- Insufficient credits
- Invalid task parameters

Always handle errors gracefully in your application to ensure stability and a smooth user experience.

---

## Best Practices

To get the best results from our CAPTCHA Solver APIs, we recommend the following:

- Store API keys securely and never expose them in client-side code
- Monitor credit usage regularly via the dashboard
- Implement retry logic for tasks that are still processing
- Ensure you have proper authorization to automate CAPTCHA-protected systems
