# Basic API Instructions

This page explains the core concepts and requirements for interacting with our CAPTCHA Solver APIs.  
Before making requests, ensure you have an active account, sufficient credits, and a valid API key.

---

## Base URL

All API requests are made over HTTPS.

```http
https://api.yourcaptchasolver.com
```

## Authentication

All API requests must be authenticated using your API key.

**Authorization Header**

Include your API key in the request headers:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

**Note -** Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories.

## Content Type

All requests and responses use JSON format.

```http
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Request Flow Overview

Most CAPTCHA-solving requests follow this standard flow:

1. Submit a CAPTCHA-solving request  
2. Receive a task ID (if processing is required)  
3. Retrieve the task result  
4. Handle the response or error  

Some tasks return results immediately, while others may require polling.

## Creating a CAPTCHA Task

To solve a CAPTCHA, submit a request to the appropriate endpoint based on the CAPTCHA type.

## API Reference

This section documents the public API endpoints available in this project.

- [/api/public/textCaptcha](./api/text-captcha) — Extract the final answer from a text input.
- [/api/public/imageCaptcha](./api/image-captcha) — Extract readable text from an image URL.

## Rate Limits

To ensure fair usage and platform stability, rate limits may apply.

If you exceed allowed limits, requests may be temporarily blocked.  
Refer to the **Rate Limits** section for detailed thresholds.
